# Images

Image elements point to either a locally stored or remote image to be displayed on the web page. The image element is designated by the image ('**img**') tag which does not have separate openning and closing tags.

The '**src**' attribute contains the URL of the locally stored or remote image to display.

## Image Tag

- **`<img src="URL" />`** - Adds image; it is a separate file located at the URL
- **`<img src="URL" align="?">`** - Aligns image left/right/center/bottom/top/middle (use CSS)
- **`<img src="URL" border="?">`** - Sets size of border surrounding image (use CSS)
- **`<img src="URL" height="?">`** - Sets height of image, in pixels
- **`<img src="URL" width="?">`** - Sets width of image, in pixels
- **`<img src="URL" alt="?">`** - Sets the alternate text for browsers that can't process images (required by the ADA)
