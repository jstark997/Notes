# HTML Element Structure

All HTML elements are encoded in what are called 'tags' which is text (the name of the element) surrounded by angle brackets ('<' an '>'). Most HTML elements have an opening tag and closing tag that surrounds either text are other HTML elements. Closing tags have a forward slash '/' in front of the name of the element.

Example paragraph element:

```html
<p>Web browsers will interpret this as a paragraph.</p>
```

In the above example of a paragraph element, the opening tag is '<p?>' and the closing tag is '</p>'.

However there a some HTML elements that do not have a separate closing tag, such as the image element.

Example image element:

```html
<img src="sunset.jpg" alt="A picture of a sunset over the ocean." />
```

In the above example the image element only consists of a single tag '<img />' containing items called attributes such as 'src' and 'alt'.
