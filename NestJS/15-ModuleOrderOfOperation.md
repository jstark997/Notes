# Module Order Of Execution

In a NestJS application, the order in which modules execute when receiving a request follows a well-defined flow. Understanding this flow helps in optimizing performance and handling the request-response lifecycle effectively. Here's the typical order of execution:

### 1. **Global Middleware**

Middleware is the first point of contact for a request. If youâ€™ve registered any global or route-specific middleware, they will be executed in the order you define.

- **Middleware execution**: NestJS passes the request through any defined middleware. Middleware is used for tasks like logging, authentication, and request transformation.
- **Execution order**: Global middleware runs first, followed by route-specific middleware.
- Middleware can choose to either terminate the request or pass it on to the next middleware in the chain.

### 2. **Guards**

After middleware, **guards** are executed. Guards determine whether the request is allowed to proceed based on authorization logic.

- **Execution order**: Guards are executed in the order they are defined. If multiple guards are applied at different levels (global, controller, or route), the guard with the most specific scope will run last.
- Guards can block the request from continuing if authorization fails.

### 3. **Interceptors (Before Handling the Request)**

Next, **interceptors** come into play. Interceptors can execute code both before and after the route handler is called, allowing you to transform the request or response.

- **Pre-processing**: Interceptors can modify the request or perform operations before passing the request to the handler.
- They follow the order of registration, with global interceptors running first and more specific interceptors (controller, method level) running afterward.

### 4. **Pipes (Validation and Transformation)**

**Pipes** are then executed, typically used for validation or transforming incoming data.

- **Execution order**: Like guards and interceptors, pipes are applied from global to method-level. The order in which pipes are declared matters.
- Pipes transform or validate the request body, query parameters, or path parameters.
- If validation fails, the request is halted, and an appropriate error response is returned.

### 5. **Route Handler (Controller)**

Once all the middleware, guards, interceptors, and pipes have successfully executed, the request finally reaches the **controller** method (the route handler).

- The controller's method handles the request and interacts with the necessary services to perform the required business logic.
- The response is returned to the caller unless further post-processing is done by an interceptor.

### 6. **Interceptors (After Handling the Request)**

After the route handler completes execution, **interceptors** are called again. This time, they are responsible for transforming the response or handling any post-processing tasks.

- **Post-processing**: Interceptors can modify the response before it's sent to the client.
- They execute in reverse order from the way they were applied before the route handler.

### 7. **Exception Filters**

If an error is thrown at any point during the request lifecycle, **exception filters** are invoked to catch and handle the error.

- Filters can either handle the error gracefully (e.g., by returning a user-friendly error message) or rethrow the error.
- Like other providers, filters follow the order of registration, starting from global down to route-specific filters.

### 8. **Response Sent to Client**

Once the entire process is completed, the final response is sent back to the client.

### Summary of Execution Order:

1. **Middleware** (global, then route-specific)
2. **Guards** (global, then controller/method-specific)
3. **Interceptors (Before)** (global, then controller/method-specific)
4. **Pipes** (global, then controller/method-specific)
5. **Route Handler** (controller)
6. **Interceptors (After)** (reverse order of before)
7. **Exception Filters** (if an error occurs)
8. **Response Sent**

By organizing your NestJS application components this way, you can effectively handle incoming requests and implement a robust, modular application.
