# What is Nest JS

NestJS is a progressive Node.js framework built with TypeScript that allows developers to build efficient and scalable server-side applications. It is heavily inspired by Angular's architecture, making it a familiar environment for developers who have worked with Angular. NestJS is built on top of Express.js (or optionally Fastify), and it adds a structured and opinionated way to create enterprise-level, maintainable applications with features like dependency injection, modularity, and TypeScript support out of the box.
