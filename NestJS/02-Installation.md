# Installation

To install NestJS, follow these steps:

1. **Install the Nest CLI**: The CLI provides useful commands for generating code and running the application.

   ```bash
   npm install -g @nestjs/cli
   ```

2. **Create a new project**: After the CLI is installed, you can create a new NestJS project by running:

   ```bash
   nest new my-nest-project
   ```

3. **Run the application**: After installing dependencies, you can run the app with:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
