# Privacy and Anonymity

**Privacy** is no one knowing what you do but potentially knowing who you are. It is about content, confidentiality and keeping secrets.

**Anonymity** is no one knowing who you are but potentially knowing what you do. It is keeping your actions and activities separate from your true identity. It means not being able to attribute your actions to you.

**Pseudonymity** is when you want to maintain a reputation against an identity. For example, having an alias to use on a forum.
