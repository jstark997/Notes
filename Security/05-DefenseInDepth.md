# Defense In Depth

Layers of security defenses:

1. Prevent (e.g. encryption)
2. Detect (e.g. canary tokens)
3. Recover (e.g. data backups)

If one layer fails the next layer can still help protect your assets.

What cannot be prevented, should be detected and what cannot be detected should be recoverable.
