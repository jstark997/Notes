# Risk Assessment

Should take a risk based approach to security so that the right controls can be put in place without unduly affecting usability.

A risk based approach requires doing basic threat modeling and risk assessment.

A risk assement would include reviewing:

1. Assets
2. Vulnerabilities
3. Threats
4. Adversaries
5. Consequences

Focus on the consequences of an asset being compromised, especially if the threats and adversaries to that asset are not obvious. This will help to determine the level of risk and the controls that would mitigate that risk.

For each risk that you decide to mitigate :

1. Select a security control
2. Implement that control
3. Assess the effectiveness of the control (make sure it is working)
4. Monitor the control (to be sure it is still effective, i.e. needs an update)

The amount of privacy and anonymity that your require is directly proportional to the amount of security you need.
