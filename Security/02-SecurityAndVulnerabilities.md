# Security and Vulnerabiliities

Security is applied to protect **assets** for example:

- Content
  - Files
  - Accounts
  - Email
  - Activity
  - Location
- Privacy
- Anonymity

Security is applied through various **controls** for example:

- VPN
- Tor
- Encryption
- 2FA
- Patching
- HTTP filter
- Firewall
- TLS
- SSH

Security is the degree to which your assets are resistant to threats from your adversaries.

Security controls are selected based on the type of threats and adversaries that we face.

A vulnerability is an opening or opportunity for an adversary to use a threat to compromise an asset.

Risk = vulnerabilities x threats x consequences

The threats and adversaries that you face are your **threat landscape or model**.

Security is particular to each individual threat model and there is no realistic one size fits all solution.

Security is a balance between usability, risk and opportunity.
