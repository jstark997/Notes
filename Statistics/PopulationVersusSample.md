# Population and Sample

A **population** consists of all the individuals under study.

- The population of a country are all the individuals residing in that country.
- The population of the computers produced by a factory are all of the computers produced by a factory for a specified time period.
- The population of polar bears are all of the polar bears in the world.

A **sample** is a subset of the population under study.

- A sample of a country is some number, less than the entire population, of the people residing in that country.
- A sample of the computers produced by a factory is some number, less than all of the computers produced, of the computers produced by the factory.
- A sample of polar bears is some number, less then the entire population, of polar bears.

It is almost always the case that studying an entire population is not possible. Therefore samples from a population are studied instead in order to draw conclusions about the population as a whole.

Some statistical measures such as mean, variance and standard deviation have population and sample variations.
