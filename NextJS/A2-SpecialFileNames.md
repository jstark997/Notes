# Special File Names

Next.js has several file names that have a special meaning to the server when they are in the app directory:

- **page.tsx** - Contains the components for the page content.
- **layout.tsx** - Wrapper for currently displayed page, useful for defining common UI elements.
- **not-found.tsx** - Displayed when the notFound function is called.
- **loading.tsx** - Displayed when a data is fetched by a server component.
- **error.tsx** - Displayed when an error occurs in a server component.
- **route.tsx** - Defines API endpoints.
