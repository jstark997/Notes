# Linear Regression

training set (features, targets) -> learning algorithm -> f

Where the result f is a function that when given an input x outputs an estimate $ \hat{y} $

The function f is the model.
The input x is the feature(s).
The output $ \hat{y} $ is the prediction (estimate of y, where y is the true value or target).

## Single Variable Linear Regression

The model f is $ f(x) = wx + b $

Where the function is the formula for a straight line and w and b are the parameters that the learning algorithm will change in order to learn the line that best fits the training data.
