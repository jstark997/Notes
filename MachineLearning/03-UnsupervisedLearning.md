# Unsupervised Learning

This set of algorithms learns the structure or pattern in a set of data that is not labeled.

Data fed into an unsupervised algorithm comes with inputs X but not with output labels Y.

This is considered 'unsupervised' because the algorithm is not given what the 'correct' output should be, but instead discovers the structure or pattern in the data on its own.

For example, a clustering algorithm might learn that a set of data can be divided into relatively distinct clusters which could be interpreted as 'groups' within the data. A common application of clustering algorithms is to group customers into different market segaments based on the information in a company's customer database.

## Major Types of Unsupervised Algorithms

- Clustering: group similar data points together
- Anomaly Detection: find unusual data points
- Dimensionality Reduction: compress data using fewer numbers
