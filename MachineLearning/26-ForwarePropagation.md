# Forward Propagation

Forward propagation is the inference algorithm that a neural network uses to make predictions.

## Handwritten Digit Recognition Example

**Note** the end result of forward propagation is a value that is the prediction of the neural network, but it can also be thought of a the function $f(x)$ computed by the neural network.
