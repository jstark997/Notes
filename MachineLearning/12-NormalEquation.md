# Normal Equation

An alternative to the gradient descent algorithm that directly solves for the parameters w and b without iterations.

- Only works for linear regression, does not generalize to other learning algorithms.
- Slow when the number of features is large (> 10,000).
- Available in some machine learning libraries, and sometimes used to implement linear regression

However, in general, gradient descent is the recommended algorithm for finding parameters w and b.
