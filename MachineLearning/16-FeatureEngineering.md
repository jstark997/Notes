# Feature Engineering

Choosing the features of a model is a critical step in the machine learning process.

**Feature engineering** is using inuition about the model domain to design new features by transforming or combining the original features.

Example:

Suppose a model for predicting house prices has 2 features the width (frontage) of a house lot and the depth of the lot. The total area of the house lot might be a better predictor of house prices. Therefore a new feature, house lot area, can be created by multiplying the width feature by the depth feature.
