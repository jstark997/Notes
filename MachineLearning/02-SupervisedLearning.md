# Supervised Learning

This set of machine learning algorithms learn X (input) to Y (output) mappings. (Most widely used set of machine learning algorithms.)

X (input) -> Y (output)

These algorithms learn from examples where for each input the correct output is known. That is they learn from labelled data.

After working on a sufficient number of examples, the result of the algorithm will be a model that will be able to take input that it has not seen before and return output that is 'correct'.

## Examples

| Input (X)         | Output (Y)             | Application         |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| email             | spam? (0 or 1)         | spam filtering      |
| audio             | text transcripts       | speech recognition  |
| English           | Spanish                | machine translation |
| ad, user info     | click? (0 or 1)        | online advertising  |
| image, radar info | position of other cars | self-driving car    |
| image of product  | defect? (0 or 1)       | visual inspection   |

## Major Types of Supervised Learning

- Regression: learning to predict a number (from an infinite set of numbers) from the input
- Classification: learning to predict a category (from a limited set of categories) from the input
