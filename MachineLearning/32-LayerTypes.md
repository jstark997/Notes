# Layer Types

1. Dense
2. Convolutional

## Dense Layer

Every unit in the layer receives as input the output of all the units in the previous layer.

## Convolutional Layer

Each unit in the layer only receives some of the output (within a certain window) of the units in the previous layer.

Popularized by Yann LeCunn.

Below is an example of a convolution neural network with 2 convolutional layers receiving as input an EKG.
