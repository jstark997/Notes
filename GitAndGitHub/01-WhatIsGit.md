# What Is Git

A distributed version control system (VCS) that allows users to manage and track changes to files over time.

Git is the most popular VCS currently.

Features:

* Track changes across files
* Compare versions of a project
* View old versions
* Revert to a previous version
* Facilitate collaboration and sharing of changes
* Combine changes

Git allows users to add checkpoints (called commits) for the changes they make. These checkpoints allow users to go back to a previous version or to merge versions (branches) together to create a new combined version.

All the checkpoints for a project are stored in a Git **repository**.

## GitHub

A service that allows users to share their repositories in the cloud so that others can view and collaborate on them.
