# Chrome Dev Tools

The Google Chrome browser has a set of built in tools, called 'dev tools', that can be used to inspect the structure and styling of web pages. Dev tools also has functionality to simulate certain actions that might affect styling such as hovering.

**Note** - Dev tools will display the default styling for an element with the label 'user agent stylesheet'.

On Mac the keyboard shortcut to bring up dev tools is 'option'+'command'+'i'.
