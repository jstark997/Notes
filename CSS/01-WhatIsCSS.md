# What Is CSS

Cascading Style Sheets or CSS is used in conjuction with HTML to describe how the content contained in a web page should be styled.

CSS contains many properties that specify different attributes of web page content such as color, font, spacing between elements, the layout of elements and much more.

Web browsers interpret CSS and display (render) a web page with the specific style properties contained in its CSS code.
