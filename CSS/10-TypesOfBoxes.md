# Types Of Boxes

- Block-level
- Inline
- Inline-block

Block-level elements, which compromise most of the HTML elements, take up all of the available width within their parent element and therefore can only be stacked on top of each other vertically.

Inline elements only take up as much width within their parent element as is necessary to display their content. These elements can be placed side by side horizontallly next to each other.

Inline-block elements behave like inline elements on the outside but like block-level elements on the inside. Specifically both height and width can be set, as well as top and bottom margins and padding. But this elements only take up as much width as their content requires and can be set side by side horizontally with other inline or inline-block elements.

**Note** - Image elements are consider inline elements, however they behave like inline-block elements since both height and width can be set on them, as well as top and bottom margins and padding.
